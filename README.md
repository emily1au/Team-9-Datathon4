# Team-9-Datathon4

**Datathon Context and Objective:** The accurate prediction of mortality in the first 24 hours following admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is of paramount importance in clinical medicine. Early and precise mortality risk assessment allows for effective resource allocation, ensuring that critical medical equipment and skilled personnel are available for the patients who need them the most. Additionally, it aids in strategic planning, allowing medical teams to prioritize interventions, tailor treatment plans, and make informed decisions about the potential benefits of aggressive versus palliative care strategies. Furthermore, early mortality predictions provide invaluable information to families, facilitating difficult conversations and helping loved ones set realistic expectations, prepare for potential outcomes, and make time-sensitive decisions about end-of-life care. In an environment where every moment counts, leveraging data from the first 24 hours of ICU admission for mortality prediction not only optimizes clinical interventions but also provides compassionate guidance to families during their most challenging times. Recognizing this, this datathon aims to explore the power of Machine Learning models to predict mortality using real-world data from that critical first day in the ICU, all with the goal of enhancing patient care and supporting families in their tough moments.


**Datasets Information:** This dataset is provided in collaboration with MITâ€™s GOSSIS community initiative and has received privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab. It includes records from over 91,000 intensive care unit (ICU) visits at various hospitals, covering an entire year. What makes this dataset truly unique is its global scope, as it is part of a collaborative effort connecting healthcare institutions in Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and over 200 hospitals in the United States.
